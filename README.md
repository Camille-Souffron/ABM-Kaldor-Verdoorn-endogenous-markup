# ABM-Kaldor-Verdoorn-endogenous-markup
Reproduction of the Agent-Based Model of Llerena &amp; Lorentz (2004) and endogeneisation of the markups, the labour market and the wage setting dynamics to simulate their cyclizing role in growth, firms' evolution and technical change in a Kaleckian/Goodwinian framework. 

Code reproduced by Mathieu Maguet, except for the Entry-Exit mechanism for firms (reproduced by myself).

Extension thought and written by myself too.

Written in C++ and to be used with LSD (LABORATORY FOR SIMULATION DEVELOPMENT), c.f. https://www.labsimdev.org/wp/

See the LSD report to see the structure and objects.
